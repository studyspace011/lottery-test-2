## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, you have two options:

**1. Simple Method (Directly opening the file)**
You can simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. However, some PWA features, like the service worker, may not function correctly with the `file:///` protocol.

**2. Recommended Method (Using a local server)**
For full functionality and reliable testing, it's best to serve the files from a local server. If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can use the **"Live Server"** extension.

1.  Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code.
2.  Right-click on the `index.html` file.
3.  Select "Open with Live Server".

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: How to See Changes After Editing Code

This project uses a **Service Worker** to make the app work offline. The service worker is very good at saving (caching) files like `style.css` and `script.js`.

Because of this, after you make changes to the code, a simple refresh (**`Ctrl+R`**) in your desktop browser might **NOT** show your changes. The browser will just load the old, saved files.

To see your latest changes, you **must** perform a **Hard Reload**.

* **On Windows/Linux (Chrome, Edge, Firefox):** Press **`Ctrl + Shift + R`**
* **On Mac (Chrome, Edge, Firefox):** Press **`Cmd + Shift + R`**

This forces the browser to ignore the cache and download the fresh files from the server. This is likely why the app was working on your mobile but not on your computer after making changes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The feedback form in the settings page uses EmailJS to send emails. To make it work, you need to configure your own keys in the `script.js` file.

Find this object in `script.js` and replace the placeholder values with your own keys from your EmailJS account:

```javascript
const EMAILJS_CONFIG = {
    publicKey: 'cR_ecVOlooNvaufB0', // Your Public Key
    serviceId: 'service_wc19lto',   // Your Service ID
    templateId: 'template_grmabah'    // Your Template ID
};
````
